    <div id="overview">
      Bike Safe is a mobile application that I developed that follows four steps. Precaution, Prevention, Recovery and Locate.
      The precaution part of the app allows the users to know if an area is safe to lock your bike, by getting crime (robbery) data around the users location.
      Prevention gives the user tips on how to better lock your bike to prevent a theft.
      Recovery allows users to post a missing bike and get the help from the community in recovering it.
      And Locate allows users to safe the location of where they lock their bike. The main goal of this app is to help reduce the number of bikes lost in NYC.
      This is all done while following the material design guidelines creating a great UI/UX experience.

        <h2 class="about-title">Authentication</h2>
        <p class="description">
          Users are authenticated with Firebase Authentication. They have a choice of either using their email or gmail accounts.
          The authentication is needed for users to upload information about their lost bikes. But mainly it is a used so users can chat with each other
          if a lost bike is found, which is an upcoming feature.

        <h2 class="about-title">Precaution</h2>
        <p class="description">
          The precaution is the main aspect of the application. This allows users to scan the area 500ft around their current location and get all the
          robbery/crime data around them. Then users are informed on whether the area is safe enough to lock your bike. The crime data is pulled in through
          the background using Async Task from NYC Open Data which provides the data in a JSON format.

        <h2 class="about-title">Recovery</h2>
        <p class="description">
          Recovery allows users who have lost their bike to post a contacts, description and picture of their lost bike including a rewards for anyone that finds it.
          This is done using the Firebase Realtime Database and Firebase Storage to store the images.

        <h2 class="about-title">Location</h2>
        <p class="description">
          Location allows users to save the location of where they locked their bike, incase they forget. Users are able to delete and add multiple locations
          which are all stored locally. So incase there is no internet access users can still access it.
